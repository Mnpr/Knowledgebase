Go inside!

### Adverbs of manner

The adverb "gern" is used often in German and it’s equivalent is "gladly".

The construction "Ich hätte gern…" is very common in German and means "I would like to" and is used to politely order something.

gern or gerne are exactly the same but gern is used more often.

### Pronoun Adverbs

Pronoun adverbs are the combination of a preposition and a pronoun and are used only to refer to things (not for living things).

#### Adverbs "da-" + preposition

The adverbs "da-" + preposition are used very often and their translation depends greatly on the context:

Ich habe nicht daran gedacht  
I didn’t think about that

| Adverb | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **daran** (or **dran**) | at it ([preposition an](moz-extension://www.germanveryeasy.com/an)) |
| **darauf** (or drauf) | on it ([preposition auf](moz-extension://www.germanveryeasy.com/auf)) |
| **daraus** | from it (preposition aus) |
| **dabei** | present ([preposition bei](moz-extension://www.germanveryeasy.com/bei)) |
| **dagegen** | against it (preposition gegen) |
| **darin** | in it ([preposition in](moz-extension://www.germanveryeasy.com/in)) |

| **dazu** | additionally ([preposition zu](moz-extension://www.germanveryeasy.com/zu)) |

The [prepositions](moz-extension://www.germanveryeasy.com/prepositions-in-german) are not exactly the same in German and English and thus the translation is not exact. Check out prepositions to get the best translation in every case.

#### Adverbs hier + preposition

The adverbs "hier-" + preposition have practically the same meaning as adverbs da + "preposition" though they are used much less often. Their meaning depends greatly on the context.

| Adverb | Meaning |
